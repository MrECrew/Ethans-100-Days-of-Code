# Ethans 100 Days of Code
You might know the 100 days of code challenge, well I'm bad at it so I'm doing my own version of it,
you can see what I did or learnt on a spesific day in its section. I aim to complete this and only
miss days if I **must**, I will eventually come back to them. I dont have any set tasks but some days
may focus on one project.

### Today I:
Technically missed day 4 yesterday, I am back on it today though. Added a muzzle flash to the gun in unity.
Also broke the animation by fixing it, my brain put it on the wrong side of the screen.

Anyways if you want to look at how my really bad project with this gun is coming: https://gyazo.com/baaf1ce82c5d44ca568759518f47cc58
