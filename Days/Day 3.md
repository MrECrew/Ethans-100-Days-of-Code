# Ethans 100 Days of Code
You might know the 100 days of code challenge, well I'm bad at it so I'm doing my own version of it,
you can see what I did or learnt on a spesific day in its section. I aim to complete this and only
miss days if I **must**, I will eventually come back to them. I dont have any set tasks but some days
may focus on one project.

### Today I:
Wrote a C# script in unity to create a animation play when you click. Also expanded the level. Hopefully
I can work more on level design soon.
