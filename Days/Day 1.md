# Ethans 100 Days of Code
You might know the 100 days of code challenge, well I'm bad at it so I'm doing my own version of it,
you can see what I did or learnt on a spesific day in its section. I aim to complete this and only
miss days if I **must**, I will eventually come back to them. I dont have any set tasks but some days
may focus on one project.

### Today I:
This is day one and I started this, I leant more of flexbox in CSS using https://flexboxfroggy.com/ and
it helped soooo much. I also worked  a bit more on my website and finished making the really simple box,
it was alot easier than I expected.

I hope to remember to do this every day!
